# Hi, I'm Henrique Cecconi

I'm a developer currently working at B3, the Stock Exchange of Brasil with Python and R.
There, I mainly use programming as a tool for analysing data, process automating, and building graphical interfaces.

Currently I'm studying web development, HTML, CSS and Ruby.

I'm fascinated by technology, love learning new languages and am always open to new chalenges.
